<h2>Who Are EPA Certified Lead Inspectors?</h2>
<p>EPA certified lead inspectors are professionals trained and authorized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to identify lead-based paint hazards in residential and commercial properties. They have completed rigorous training, passed certification exams, and adhere to strict standards to ensure accurate and reliable lead detection.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Accurate Testing:</strong> Certified inspectors use advanced tools like X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyzers to detect lead without damaging surfaces.</p>

<h2>What Does an EPA Certified Lead Inspector Do?</h2>
<h2>1. Property Evaluation</h2>
<p>Inspectors first assess the property's age, condition, and history of lead paint use to plan the inspection.</p>
<h2>2. XRF Testing</h2>
<p>Using handheld XRF analyzers, inspectors scan all painted surfaces-walls, doors, windows, trim, and exteriors-to detect lead content quickly and non-destructively.</p>
<h2>3. Visual Inspection</h2>
<p>They look for deteriorated paint, dust, or soil contamination that may pose lead hazards.</p>
<h2>4. Sample Collection</h2>
<p>In some cases, inspectors collect paint chips or dust wipe samples for laboratory analysis to confirm lead presence.</p>
<h2>5. Reporting</h2>
<p>Inspectors provide detailed digital reports outlining where lead-based paint is found, hazard levels, and recommendations for remediation or interim controls.</p>
